# wheatley-library
A Website for the  Wheatley Elementary School Library in downtown Louisville, KY. The responsive site--which includes schedules, rules and policies, contact info, and book and author recommendations--is intended to be a resource for students, teachers, and parents. I used Bootstrap to create a responsive navbar for both mobile and larger screens, created a sticky footer as some pages have relatively little content, and used Flexbox and media queries to format body content and make it responsive to different screen sizes. 

To view the site, run index.html and click on the navbar tabs to go back and forth between pages.
